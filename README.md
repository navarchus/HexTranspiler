# HexTranspiler
Pseudocode Transpiler for Hexcasting
<br>
Current minecraft version supported: 1.20.1

TODO:
- Great spell import support
- Fuzzy matching cases (ex: allow fireball to match Fireball)
- Better error messages/messages for bad input
- Support for multiple LUT to allow for different lookups on a per-mod basis
- optimized numerical reflection (https://s5bug.github.io/squiggler/)??
- Maybe attempt macros/higher level programming concepts?
- File consisting of only invalid symbols outputs empty hex
